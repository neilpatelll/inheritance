## Classes

- `Appointment.java`: A class representing an appointment.
- `Car.java`: A class representing a car.
- `CombinationLock.java`: A subclass of `Lock` representing a combination lock.
- `Date.java`: A class representing a date.
- `Inheritance.java`: The main class demonstrating the usage of inheritance.
- `Lock.java`: The base class representing a lock.
- `Scheduler.java`: A class related to scheduling appointments.

## Inheritance Hierarchy

Based on the provided files, the inheritance hierarchy in this project seems to be:
    Lock
      |
      |
CombinationLock

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/inheritance-example.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd inheritance-example`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`

## Usage

To run the application, execute the `Inheritance` class:
java Inheritance

This will demonstrate the usage of the inheritance hierarchy by creating instances of the subclasses (`CombinationLock`) and invoking their inherited and overridden methods.
